Let them get paid for actually investing their time to educate themselves.</p><h1 class="mt-8 text-xl ">The NFT Courses Marketplace will be the heart of the project.<!-- --> </h1><br/><p class="mt-8 text-xl">This will be a marketplace where the ( Teachers in this case) will be able to upload their course content to IPFS and create an ERC-1155 NFT. This NFT will serve as an access to the course. Teachers will be allowed to set a limit of owners. This will allow students to sell their NFTs after completion and for the teacher to (for most of the time) have the same amount of students that are covering the course. The first payment will be fully transferred to the teacher, after that from each resell the creator would get a creator fee.</p><br/><h2 class="mt-8 text-xl">          <!-- --> Where SuperFluid would be an amazing help!<!-- --> </h2><p class="mt-8 text-xl">The Treasury is the donations or bounties the project will receive from partners/sponsors. These days many fields lack resources and therefore students have less motivation to study those fields. To assist students, the project will set a stream of income for studying, from the treasury.<br/>The Treasury could also support ads related to the education sector. Students could get extra stream rewards if they accept to see advertisements.</p><h2 class="mt-8 text-xl"> <!-- -->How can I know if the student is actually studying?<!-- --> </h2><p class="mt-8 text-xl">There are many solutions to that problem! One of them is to have diplomas/certificates of completion. A student could receive a diploma (NFT) of 2 levels: Normal and Tested. The difference between them is that in Tested, the professor/content creator/moderator personally checked the knowledge of the student. This would be a paid option. A potential checkpoint in the roadmap would be to create a university on the platform!</p><p class="mt-8 text-xl">Takeaways: Given time and team, it is possible to build an operating learn2earn system using solutions provided by SuperFluid. This project’s essential view is to help people with low income to get proper education. Thanks for reading this far!</p></div></div></div></div><script id="__NEXT_DATA__" type="application/json">{"props":{"pageProps":{}},"page":"/","query":{},"buildId":"ssMvACEiXFsjUeCYxvG-A","nextExport":true,"autoExport":true,"isFallback":false,"scriptLoader":[]}</script></body></html>
